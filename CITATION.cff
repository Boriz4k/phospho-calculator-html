abstract: "Interactive web-based tool for simulating phosphorylation state distributions and their resulting deconvoluted mass spectra in mass spectrometry. Models combinatorial phosphorylation patterns across 10 sites with real-time visualization. Features side-by-side layout, responsive design, and automatic peak annotation. Developed from Excel prototype using AI-assisted programming."
